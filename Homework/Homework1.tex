\noindent \textbf{2. Whenever a computer system must interact with an I/O device, briefly explain how we can utilize the CPU efficiently.} \\

\textcolor{red}{We can utilize the CPU efficiently during interactions with I/O devices by employing techniques such as Direct Memory Access (DMA) and interrupts. DMA allows the device controller to handle data transfers directly between the I/O device and memory, bypassing the CPU. This reduces the CPU's workload and enables it to focus on other tasks. Additionally, interrupts improve CPU utilization by signaling the CPU only when the I/O device has completed its task. This approach allows the CPU to work on other processes instead of waiting idly. By combining DMA and interrupts, we can optimize the CPU's efficiency when managing interactions with I/O devices.}
\newpage

\noindent \textbf{3. In a computer with one CPU, why could a user experience that multiple programs are running simultaneously? Also, specify the terms related.} \\

\textcolor{red}{A single CPU can give the illusion of running multiple programs simultaneously through techniques such as multiprogramming and multitasking. In multiprogramming, the operating system (OS) loads multiple processes into memory and switches to another process when the current one is waiting for resources, resuming it later using an interrupt. In multitasking, the OS rapidly switches between processes, allocating each a short time slice, creating the perception of parallel execution. If the CPU has multiple cores, it can achieve parallelism by executing instructions concurrently.}
\newpage

\noindent \textbf{4. What is the main advantage of the microkernel approach to system design? What are the disadvantages of using the microkernel approach?} \\

\textcolor{red}{The microkernel approach removes all nonessential components from the kernel and implements them as user-level programs in separate address spaces. The main advantage of this design is that it simplifies extending the operating system, as new services can be added without modifying the kernel. Additionally, it enhances security and reliability because most services run in user space rather than kernel space. However, the microkernel approach can suffer from performance issues due to increased overhead from system calls and inter-process communication. The separation of the kernel and user-space services also leads to slower OS operations.}
\newpage

\noindent \textbf{5. What are the advantages of using loadable kernel modules?} \\ 

\textcolor{red}{Loadable kernel modules are loaded into the OS kernel only when needed and can be removed when no longer necessary. This design makes the OS more flexible, as it allows new features to be added directly to the kernel without requiring a system reboot or recompilatio}
